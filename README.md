# express-basic

Basic repo for building out a Node express app

## How to use this repo

Create a fork, run `npm i` to install dependencies then build out your required functionality.

The scripts provided allow for hot reloading while developing, linting with `standard`, code coverage with `c8` and unit testing with `mocha` (test runner), `chai` (assertions) and `sinon` (stubbing/spying).

There is a basic `/healthcheck` route and a functional pattern for testing and setting up routes.
